The App is hosted using firebase

https://clone-d1c37.web.app/

## WHAT I DID?

By using reaction fucntionial components and hooks, created the amazon clone. In order to avoid any sort of prop drilling, google firebase was used for data managment and creating a data layer. React Context API is used to pull the data and pass it down or up into different components.

Also a login and sign up system is setup using firebase authentication tools.
